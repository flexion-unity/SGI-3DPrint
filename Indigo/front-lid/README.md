3D-printed spare parts for the Silicon Graphics Iris Indigo

### Front Lid Door Clips

If the front lid clips are bent or broken, you can print replacement clips using your 3D printer.

Top Clip: [SGI-Indigo-Door-Top-Clip.stl](SGI-Indigo-Door-Top-Clip.stl)

Bottom Clip: [SGI-Indigo-Door-Bottom-Clip.stl](SGI-Indigo-Door-Bottom-Clip.stl)


3D print settings:

- No support required.
- Infill 100%
- Print with the clip facing upwards, as shown in the picture.

Use fine grained sand paper on the curved front side of the clip for smooth operation. Completely remove the old broken clip from the front lid using a Dremel tool or knife, then attach the new 3D printed clip on the inside of the lid as shown in the photo with some plastic- or hot glue.
