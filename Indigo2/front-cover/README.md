### Front Cover Clip

If the front cover clips of your Indigo2 are broken, you can print replacement clips using your 3D printer. There is one clip design that fits both sides, although I only tested the left one so far.

Clip for left or right side: [SGI-Indigo2-Front-Cover-Clip.stl](SGI-Indigo2-Front-Cover-Clip.stl)

3D print settings:

- Add support on build plate only
- Print with front of the clip facing downwards, as shown in the picture.

Remove the old broken clip from the cover using a Dremel tool, flush cut any remainings carefully.
To install the clip, mount the front cover on the Indigo2 case and insert the clip through the hole until you hear it click. No glue needed, but you can also glue the clip to the cover if you like.
